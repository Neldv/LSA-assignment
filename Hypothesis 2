### Research question 2
hypothesis 2 : Do BMI category and gender have an effect on the C T cell count?

```{r}
# Select columns from each dataframe

cd4_data <- metadata_flu %>% filter(name_formatted == "CD4_pos_T_cells" )


#All measurements for CD4 T cells are in the same unit : % of parent cell population, therefore we won't include this column in our new dataframe.
cd4_df <- cd4_data %>% select(donor_id, name_formatted, data)
bmi_gender<- distinct_data %>% select(donor_id, bmi, gender)

# Merge the dataframes
cd4_bmi_gender <- left_join(cd4_df, bmi_gender, by = "donor_id")

# View the merged dataframe
head(cd4_bmi_gender)
summary (cd4_bmi_gender)
```

Some don't have data for bmi.
```{r}
mean(is.na(cd4_bmi_gender$bmi))
```
24.8% of the individuals with a measurement for CD4+ T cell have not reported their BMI. We suspect this is mostly due to reporting bias as some people don't know their length/weight or don't want to share it. 

```{r}
install.packages("naniar") 
library(naniar)

# Visualize missing values
vis_miss(cd4_bmi_gender) 
```

We're going to take out all the individuals that miss the BMI value, as this is not useful for our hypothesis.

```{r}
cd4_bmi_cleaned <- cd4_bmi_gender[!is.na(cd4_bmi_gender$bmi), ]
summary(cd4_bmi_cleaned)
```
First we'll look at the range of the data. The maximum value for BMI is 46.89 and the minimum value is 13.12, both are plausible for BMI.
 The 'data' column, which contains the value for the percentage of parent cell population that is CD4 T cells, should be between 0 and 100, as its expressed in %. 
This is the case, so we conclude that neither column has outliers that are suspicious. 
Below, both distributions are visualised in a histogram.


```{r}
cd4_bmi_cleaned%>%
  ggplot(aes(x= bmi))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill ='darkseagreen', color="black")+
  labs(title = "Histogram of BMI", x = "BMI", y="Frequency")+
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
cd4_bmi_cleaned%>%
  ggplot(aes(x= data))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill ='darkseagreen4', color="black")+
  labs(title = "Histogram of CD4+ T cell percentage of parent population in the patient", x = "CD4+ T cell percentage of parent population", y="Frequency")+
  theme_minimal()
```
We're going to split the BMI numbers in groups according to the universal standard : underweight (BMI>18.5), healthy(18.5=<BMI<25), overweight(25<=BMI<30) and obese (BMI>=30)

```{r}
cd4_bmicat <- cd4_bmi_cleaned %>%
  mutate(BMI_category = case_when(
    bmi < 18.5 ~ "underweight",
    bmi >= 18.5 & bmi < 25 ~ "healthy",
    bmi >= 25 & bmi <30 ~ "overweight",
    bmi>=30 ~ "obese"
  ))


cd4_bmicat$BMI_category<- as.factor(cd4_bmicat$BMI_category)
head(cd4_bmicat)
summary(cd4_bmicat)

```

In this hypothesis we are going to look at the effect of gender and BMI class on CD4 T cell percentage.
In total we have 329 individuals in our dataframe. All observations are obtained from different individuals, therefore we can conclude that the groups are independent. 

Below, we specified the variables.
CD4: Dependent variable (continuous).
BMI: Independent variable (categorical, ordinal).
Gender: Independent variable (categorical, nominal).




First, we'll fit a linear model to this

```{r}
model <- lm(data ~ bmi * gender, data = cd4_bmicat)
summary (model)
```
We want the healthy weight category to be the baseline.

```{r}
cd4_bmicat$BMI_category <- relevel(cd4_bmicat$BMI_category, ref = "healthy")
model <- lm(data ~ BMI_category * gender, data = cd4_bmicat)
summary(model)
```

To test the significance of the predictors, an ANOVA test will be executed. 

To be able to perform an ANOVA test, the data needs to comply to certain conditions :
- The data within each group is approximately normally distributed (can check with Q-Q plots or Shapiro-Wilk test).
- Homogeneity of variances = homoscedasticity (can test using Levene’s test).

Normality testing of the continuous variable

```{r}
install.packages("ggpubr")
library(ggpubr)
# plot for all data
ggqqplot(cd4_bmicat$data)+
  ggtitle("CD4 T cells percentage of parent population")
```
```{r}
shapiro.test(cd4_bmicat$data)
```
p-value > 0.05: The data is approximately normal for that category.
p-value ≤ 0.05: The data significantly deviates from normality.

```{r}
ggqqplot(cd4_bmicat, "data", ggtheme = theme_minimal()) +
  facet_grid(BMI_category ~ gender) +
  labs(title = "Q-Q Plots of CD4 Counts by BMI Class and Gender")
```


```{r}
# 1) Center and spread of CD4 T cell count
CD4_per_cat<-cd4_bmicat%>%
  group_by(BMI_category)%>%
  summarise(MeanData = mean(data),
            sdData = sd(data))
CD4_per_cat
```
```{r}
bartlett.test(data ~ BMI_category, data = cd4_bmicat)
```

```{r}
bartlett.test(data ~ gender, data = cd4_bmicat)
```
Interpreting the Results
The Bartlett test produces:

Statistic: Bartlett’s K-squared.

p-value: Used to determine if variances are equal.

Null Hypothesis (H₀): Variances across groups are equal.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): At least one group has a different variance.

Decision Rule:

If p-value < 0.05, reject H₀ (variances are not equal).
If p-value ≥ 0.05, fail to reject H₀ (variances are equal).


The p value is higher than 0.05 (0.21), therefore we conclude that the variance is approximately equal across all categories.

=> the conditions of normality and approximately equal variance are met => The anova test can be applied
```{r}
anova(model)
```
```{r}
plot(model, which = 1, main = "Residuals vs. Fitted")
```
```{r}
plot(model, which = 2, main = "Normal Q-Q Plot")
```
```{r}
ggplot(cd4_bmicat, aes(x = BMI_category, y = data, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "CD4 Cell Count by BMI Class and Gender",
    x = "BMI Class",
    y = "CD4 Cell Count"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Male" = "royalblue", "Female" = "pink")) +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r}
interaction.plot(
  x.factor = cd4_bmicat$BMI_category,
  trace.factor = cd4_bmicat$gender,
  response = cd4_bmicat$data,
  fun = mean,
  col = c("blue", "pink"),
  lty = 1,
  type = "b",
  legend = TRUE,
  xlab = "BMI Class",
  ylab = "Mean CD4 Count",
  main = "Interaction Plot: BMI Class and Gender on CD4 Count"
)
```





##OTHER APPROACH

All values for CD4 T cell percentage , that are situated in the column 'data', are percentages lying between 0 and 100. For further use of the data, an additional column will be added where the percentages are given in decimals, so they all lie in between 0 and 1. 
As the beta regression is made for dependent variables that can have any value between 0 and 1, the interaction model will be made using this.

verify there are no strict 0 and strict 1 values 
```{r}
cd4_bmicat$cd4_proportion<- cd4_bmicat$data / 100
summary(cd4_bmicat$cd4_proportion)
```
There are no strict 0 or strict 1 values so the beta regression can be applied


```{r}

library(betareg)
beta_model <- betareg(cd4_proportion ~ BMI_category * gender, data = cd4_bmicat)
summary(beta_model) 
```
Betaregression requires

To test whether the predictors or interactions are significant, apart from the result of the beta regression, a likelihood ratio test will be performed

```{r}
reduced_model <- betareg(cd4_proportion ~ BMI_category + gender, data = cd4_bmicat)

library(lmtest)

lrtest(beta_model, reduced_model)
```
The p value is >0.05, this indicates that the interaction between gender and BMI category is not signficant.

However, the chosen predictors only explain a little variance. Most of the variance is due to other factors. BMI category and gender are significant for CD4 T cell count, but only for the 7% of the variance it explains.
